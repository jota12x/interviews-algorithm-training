# interviews-algorithm-training
This repo presents several tasks for training in programming interviews. It includes theory and practice.



**Notes**
* Problems from books don't have input data, so I prepared some when necessary. I recommend the following command for running them:
```g++ (program).cpp
./a.out <input/{file}.txt>
```
